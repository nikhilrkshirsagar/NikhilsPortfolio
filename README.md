## About Me
I am Nikhil Kshirsagar, an esteemed IT professional boasting over 13 years of expertise

current organization, I have spearheaded and overseen numerous pioneering projects 
tailored for esteemed entities such as the Health Resources and Services Administration 
(HRSA), NASA, and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA).

 Beyond the realms of my professional endeavors, I am a vibrant individual with a myriad 
of passions. I relish quality time spent indulging in my diverse array of hobbies. A 
wordsmith at heart, I find solace in the art of writing and poetry, enriching the Marathi 
community in Washington DC through my dedicated volunteer work. As an avid reader, I 
am endlessly fascinated by the realms of literature. Music also holds a special place in my 
heart; I enjoy playing the guitar for pure enjoyment and self-expression.

 Additionally, I find serenity amidst nature's embrace, often enjoying parks, small hikes 
alongside my cherished family. Speaking of which, my beloved wife, Poornima, along 
with our delightful 8-year-old daughter, Ovee, and spirited 4-year-old son, Yash, 
complete the tapestry of joy in my life.
